 This game or application is often called the Number Guessing Game or the Pick A Number game.

 The objective of this game is to guess the correct random number in the least amount of tries. The user has to pick a number between 1 and 100. The game will tell the user whether their guess is too high or too low, which nudges the user closer to the correct value. If the correct number is guessed, the game is done. This game is often used to compete with friends to see who can get the answer in the lowest number of guesses.
